# Klipper-Macros
A collection of all my macros.

Most of these macros are here just so that its easy for me to grab them when I need them on a project, but feel free to use them however you like.
Some are spesific to that particular printer, other need some configuring to work properly, I will try to make notes in the files to explain if they need spesific changes.
